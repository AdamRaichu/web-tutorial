      <h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
      <p>Modern websites are built on 3 main languages: HyperText Markup Language (HTML); Cascading Style Sheets (CSS); and JavaScript (JS).</p>
      <h2 id="intro-html">HTML</h2>
      <p>HTML documents contain the basic text and images that make up web pages, as well as links to other resources (such as CSS and JS files).</p>
      <p>Here is an example of a page that uses only HTML.</p>
      <iframe src="examples/intro/html-only/"></iframe>
      <p>Here is the code used in the example.</p>
      <pre class="hljs"><code id="code-ex1">loading...</code></pre>
      <p>As you can see from the example, HTML by itself is fairly boring. <i>Actually, saying this is only HTML is slightly inaccurate. There is no <b>added</b> CSS. Your browser adds a little bit of CSS to the pages you visit, but the rules they add are of the lowest priority in the style tree. This point is fairly minor, but I take pride in being accurate.</i> Anyway, the point is unless you add your own CSS, web pages are fairly boring.</p>
      <h2 id="intro-css">CSS</h2>
      <p>CSS documents provide visual instructions to the browser for rendering HTML. You can use a variety of selectors for specifying styling, which are applied in order of specificity, from least specific to most specific.</p>
      <p>The following example is the same as the first, except that it added <code id="code-ex2-inline" class="hljs">loading...</code>. This line loads the following CSS file.</p>
      <pre class="hljs"><code id="code-ex2-main">loading...</code></pre>
      <iframe src="examples/intro/html-css/"></iframe>
      <h2 id="intro-js">JS</h2>
      <p>JavaScript is the most complicated of the 3 languages mainly because it has so many different things to learn. With HTML and CSS, it's simply a matter of learning the basics and picking up new tricks as you continue coding. With JS, there are a massive number of keywords, you need to learn operators, AND every single JS file you run can add more functions to the global context. (That's a fancy way of saying the main JS context.) However, it is the most useful of the 3 for making interesting content such as games.</p>
